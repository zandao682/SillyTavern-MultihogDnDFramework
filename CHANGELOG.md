# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Fatbody D&D Framework** will be documented in this file.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **Lorebook Agent Data Loss**: Fixed a critical bug where the Lorebook Agent would fail to recognize manually cloned or renamed campaign lorebooks due to stale frontend caches. The agent now explicitly probes the backend server (`/api/worldinfo/get` and `/api/settings/get`) before initializing a new book, completely preventing the accidental overwriting and deletion of existing lorebook files.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Automated World Engine**: Implemented a comprehensive "World Engine" simulation block in the Lorebook Agent. The agent now tracks the passage of time and automatically generates missing daily background reports for off-screen NPC actions and faction events, creating a persistent, living world that evolves independently of the player.
- **Editable Modular Agent Instructions**: Exposed all Lorebook Agent formatting rules and module-specific logic (LOC, FAC, WORLD, Custom Tags) into a single, unified text area in the settings UI. Advanced users can now fully customize or rewrite the internal logic and formatting rules of the Lorebook Agent.

### Fixed
- **Tag Parsing Robustness**: Fixed a critical parser bug where multi-line or multi-paragraph entries (like the new verbose WORLD reports) were being truncated. The generic tag parser now safely captures tags spanning across newlines.
- **Legacy Constraints**: Backported the `<world_engine>` narrative constraint to `sysprompt_legacy.txt` to prevent NPCs in legacy mode from spontaneously blurting out background world events that the player shouldn't know about.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-05-18
### Fixed
- **Keyword Scanner Latency**: Eliminated a critical 5-second prompt compilation and message delay by removing the expensive, synchronous `updateWorldInfoList` disk-reindexing call from the scanner's fallback path. The read-only keyword scanner now operates purely in-memory, relying on the already-current registry and an in-memory `routerLog` backup for instant performance.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- **Rollback Data Safety**: Patched a critical bug in `rollbackRouterPass` where an empty or missing campaign prefix would fall back to the entire SillyTavern library, deleting or clearing unrelated lorebooks. The deletion step now safely ignores empty scopes when no campaign prefix is active.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Lorebook Agent Cleanup Mode**: Implemented a comprehensive cleanup mode pass to consolidate bloated lorebook entries.
  - **Tool-call actions**: Support for `rewrite` (single entry compression) and `consolidate` (many-to-one merge + delete) operations.
  - **Custom directives**: Manual global and per-entry cleanups prompt for custom instructions (e.g. "Preserve history, condense mechanics").
  - **Auto-cleanup settings**: Toggles for automatic background runs every N turns and custom token size thresholds.
  - **Bypassing controls**: Added "Use Token Threshold" checkbox to selectively include or exclude the size barrier.
- **Estimated Token Displays**: Real-time token estimators next to category titles, entry list items, and active keys to monitor budget consumption at a glance.
- **Event Isolation**: Fixed interactive controls getting stuck in draggable panels by selective event propagation filters.

## [2.3.8] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Clone Stack**: New "Clone Stack" button in the Lorebook Agent settings. Duplicates every lorebook in the active campaign stack (e.g. `Eldoria_NPCs`, `Eldoria_Locations`) under a new user-specified prefix. Designed to prepare a parallel lorebook set before creating a SillyTavern branch chat — name the branch to match the new prefix and the framework links it automatically.

## [2.3.7] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Immersion Mode Collapsibility**: Both the RPG State Tracker and Lorebook Agent panels can now be fully collapsed to their header bars by clicking the header collapse button or double-clicking the header.
- **Auto-Expansion Synergy**: Opening the Lorebook Agent panel automatically expands the main RPG Tracker panel if it is collapsed, preventing child element clipping.

### Changed
- **Mobile UI Spacing Optimization**:
    - Hid the on/off (power) buttons (`⏻`) exclusively on mobile viewports to reclaim precious screen real estate.
    - Vertically enlarged the header bars for a more prominent, premium look on mobile screens.
    - Scaled up the other action buttons and increased icon sizes for highly comfortable touch interactions.

### Fixed
- **Stale Collapsed Heights**: Added min-height guards on startup to prevent restoring a collapsed header height (from stale pre-collapse session geometry) as the default expanded height.
- **High-Specificity CSS Override**: Resolved a CSS clash where a specific ID-based display: block !important rule prevented the Lorebook Agent's content container from collapsing.

## [2.3.6] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **Keyword Persistence**: Corrected an ordering bug in `onChatChanged` where switching chats would wipe the departing chat's keyword-activated lore (yellow pills) before it could be saved.



### Added
- **Atmospheric Time Tracker**: [TIME] block text now dynamically changes color based on the hour of day (Dawn, Midday, Sunset, Night) to match the existing emoji logic.

### Changed
- **UI Modernization & Cleanup**:
    - Removed redundant **Max Tokens** field from all UI sections.
    - Renamed **Max Turns** to **Max Agent Turns** and **Max Active** to **Max Active Keys**.
    - Removed bullet points from [TIME] block card items for a cleaner look.
    - Relocated **Reset Stock Modules** button to the Modules section for better grouping.
    - Renamed reset buttons to **Reset Core Prompt** and **Reset Stock Modules**.
- **Hardened Lorebook Injection**: Implemented a third-pass injection in the narrative interceptor to ensure Agent-owned active entries (grey pills) are correctly included in the AI context.
- **System Prompt Hardening**: Updated the template with a strict "NEVER ignore a module" directive to improve instruction following.
- **Module Optimization**: Removed "Location" from the [TIME] module prompt (now exclusively handled by the status footer).

### Fixed
- **Scenario Profiles**: Restored the missing **Delete** button for scenario profiles.



### Fixed
- **Lorebook deactivation on chat switch**: replaced fragile `_Letters` name-pattern heuristic with an exact lookup against the canonical `campaignBooks` lists stored per chat in `chatStates`. Only books the extension itself recorded as managed are ever deactivated — user-created lorebooks with any name are never touched.

## [2.2.7] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- **Modular slot bar**: Tuned `+` / `×` controls smaller (~15px, lighter borders) after v2.2.6 overshoot.

## [2.2.6] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- **Modular slot bar**: Larger, higher-contrast `+` / `×` controls (26px touch targets, bordered pill backgrounds) for add/remove middle slots.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- **Slot editor: add/remove support** — `+` button adds a new middle slot before Keywords; `×` on any middle slot removes it. Works for both stock modules and custom tags.
- **Custom tags now have a format** — same slot bar UI as stock modules; `format` field added to custom tag objects (migrated on load). The prompt builder and parser both use it.
- **Parser simplified** — FAC and QUEST dedicated branches removed; the generic `first=name, middle=body, last=keywords` branch handles all tags uniformly, including any number of slots.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- **Modular Repertoire slot editor**: Each stock module row now shows an inline `[[TAG: Name | slot | … | Keywords]]` bar. Middle slot names are editable inputs that steer what the AI writes in each pipe section. Name and Keywords chips are fixed/dimmed. Reset restores both slots and instruction.
- **Generic tag parser**: Middle segments (everything between first and last pipe) are all joined as entry body, so any number of renamed middle slots works automatically for NPC, LOC, EVENT and custom tags.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- **Basic Mode FAC tag**: Default template is now four fields — `Name | Status | Description | Keywords`. Status is a short current-state line; Description holds the longer narrative. Parser joins both into entry content; old three-field `[[FAC: Name | Description | Keywords]]` tags still work. Existing saves using the previous default `format` string are migrated on load. Module reset now restores both `instruction` and `format`.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- **Lorebook Agent panel layout**: Active Lore Keys now use normal document flow on desktop and detached panels (`#rpg-tracker-agent .rpg-tracker-content` block layout + `min-height: 0`), so wrapped pills push the Lorebook Terminal down instead of overlapping it. Removed temporary layout debug instrumentation.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- **Keyword scan accumulator**: Keyword-triggered lorebook entries are now accumulated across throttled turns (`routerRunEvery > 1`). Previously entries triggered on skipped turns were silently dropped; now the full set since the last agent run is passed as `NEWLY ACTIVATED THIS TURN` when the agent fires.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- **Lorebook Agent pipeline**: Managed campaign lorebook entries are stored inactive (`disable: true`) and patched on init/chat switch so SillyTavern’s native keyword activation does not run one turn behind narrator output.
- **Assistant-output keyword scan** (`onGenerationEnded`): Before the State Tracker and Lorebook Agent, the last assistant-side narrative is scanned; inactive entries whose `key[]` match (case-insensitive) are appended to `activeRouterKeys` immediately so the same agent pass sees full bodies.
- **Agent context**: Budget block plus optional overflow instruction; **NEWLY ACTIVATED THIS TURN** for scanner hits; archive index excludes already-active entries; FIFO auto-trim of active keys removed — overflow must be resolved via **deactivate** in **commit**.
- **Prompts**: Built-in agent/basic memory-limit copy and bundled default Lorebook Agent system prompt updated for the new budget and activation model; **Reset Agent Prompt** now restores that canonical default.
- **Defaults / UX**: Lorebook context lookback default **4**; UI labels clarify lookback is **last N chat messages (user/assistant)**; optional visual hint for keyword-triggered active keys for one turn.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-05-13
> ⚠️ **Pre-fucking change that will likely need 2 years of debugging.**
> The lorebook prefix system has been gutted and rebuilt from scratch.
> If something is inexplicably broken, it's probably this.

### Changed
- **Lorebook prefix now derived from the raw chat ID** (`ctx.chatId`) at the moment of use — no more stored setting, no more 800ms timer races, no more stale "Assistant" prefix poisoning everything. The chat ID IS the namespace.
- **Prefix derivation is simple and format-agnostic**: just sanitize the chat ID to alphanumeric+underscores. No regex demanding ST's default `Name - timestamp` format. Renamed chats work. Numeric IDs work. Everything works or at least fails loudly.
- **Strict book matching**: a lorebook belongs to a chat only if its name is exactly `prefix` or `prefix_<SingleAlphaWord>`. No partial prefix matches. "Assistant" no longer reaches across sessions and activates 47 lorebooks.
- **Removed manual Campaign Root UI**: the prefix input, Pick & Activate button, and Link button are gone from the settings panel. Replaced with a read-only display of the auto-derived prefix.
- **`activateCampaignBooks` bails with an empty prefix** instead of activating every lorebook on disk.
- **`loadChatState` no longer restores `routerCampaignPrefix`** from saved state. Stale values from old runs can no longer resurface.
- **Deactivation on chat switch** now happens unconditionally (not only when there are matching books), so switching to a new empty chat correctly clears the previous session's lorebooks.

### Added
- **Apply System Prompt button on the onboarding screen** — same as the one in the settings panel. Previously toggling onboarding options saved settings but never actually applied the prompt.
- **`scheduleAutoApply()` wired into onboarding toggles** so changing RNG mode, quest options, or components on the onboarding screen immediately updates the system prompt.

## [1.10.41] - 2026-05-12
### Added
- **Persona Character Creation**: Added a new `🎭 Persona` archetype option to the startup onboarding screen. This feature resolves the active SillyTavern persona description via macro replacement and feeds it as a direct instruction to generate a custom-tailored D&D character matching the specified persona and starting level.

## [1.8.29] - 2026-05-11
### Added
- **Direct Prompt & Adjustable Lookback**: Added the ability to send direct commands to the Lorebook Agent and adjust the number of recent chat messages (lookback) it analyzes.
- **UI Syncing**: Integrated lookback controls into both the agent panel and the main settings drawer with real-time value synchronization.

### Fixed
- **Lint Fixes**: Resolved HTMLElement property access errors in the agent panel's detachment logic by implementing proper type casting.

## [1.8.28] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- **Renderer Stabilization**: Ported the definitive rendering engine from the `main` branch to resolve fragility in character card generation. This introduces "sticky entity" logic where unrecognized lines are gracefully attached to the current card instead of resetting the context, preventing UI disintegration during template modifications.
- **Stock Field Rules**: Ported `STOCK_FIELD_RULES` and specialized renderers for HD Pips and Spell Groups for parity with the stable branch.

## [1.8.27] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- **Lorebook Agent Rebranding**: Rebranded the "Router Agent" to the **Lorebook Agent** to better reflect its role in managing campaign lore and consistency.
- **Detachable Agent Panel**: The Lorebook Agent panel is now detachable. Click the ⧉ icon in the agent header to pop it out into a standalone, draggable window.
- **Resizable Agent UI**: Detached agent panels are now fully resizable. Grab the corner or edges to adjust the workspace to your preference.
- **Geometry Persistence**: The position and dimensions of the detached Lorebook Agent are automatically saved and restored across sessions.
- **Enhanced System Prompt**: Updated the default Lorebook Agent instructions to emphasize location persistence, multi-entry turns, and entity synchronization.
- **Dynamic Variable Support**: Added `{{user}}` as a supported variable in the agent's system prompt, which automatically resolves to the player's name.
- **API Standardization**: Ported the critical `sendStateRequest` fix from `main`, standardizing LLM request construction to prevent API errors on certain SillyTavern builds when using connection profiles.

### Changed
- **Terminal Rebranding**: Renamed the agent's feedback loop to the **Lorebook Terminal**.
- **Internal Event Refactor**: Updated internal event bus to use `rt_lore_agent_*` naming for improved codebase clarity and future-proofing.
- **Agent Icons**: Updated UI icons and tool-tips to match the new Lorebook branding.

## [1.8.26] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- **New Rendering Marker**: Added `((HP))` as a shorthand for creating a character health bar.
- **Sticky Entity Context**: Attribute rows (Attr, Skills, Saves, etc.) now automatically attach to the last rendered character even if separated by narrative text.

### Fixed
- **API Compatibility**: Fixed a silent failure in extension initialization by updating `setExtensionPrompt` calls to support the latest SillyTavern API requirements (4-7 arguments).
- **Rendering Stability**: Resolved syntax errors in `renderer.js` when processing complex character blocks.
- **Sync Fixes**: Synchronized core rendering fixes from `main` into the `feature/quests` branch.

## [1.8.25] - 2026-05-10

**Fix: Renderer Syntax Error**
Resolved a syntax error in the quest renderer introduced in the previous update.

### Fixed
- **Renderer Stability**: Fixed an accidental duplicate closing tag that was causing the script to crash on load.

## [1.8.24] - 2026-05-10

**Optimization: Completed Quest Filtering**
Completed quests are now stripped from the AI context to save tokens, while remaining visible in the UI.

### Added
- **UI Sub-Section**: Completed quests are now visually separated into their own collapsible "✅ COMPLETED" sub-section at the bottom of the quest log.
- **Context Pruning**: The serialization engine now filters out any quest with `STATUS: completed` before injecting the `[QUESTS]` block into the state memo, preventing resolved narrative threads from consuming valuable context window space.
- **State Persistence**: The legacy text block parser was updated to intelligently merge incoming active quests with the locally stored completed quests, ensuring history isn't lost when the AI inevitably echoes back a block missing the completed entries.

## [1.8.23] - 2026-05-10

**Refactor: Mood is Engine-Computed Only**
Reverted AI-MOOD override from 1.8.22. The engine is the exclusive source of truth for NPC mood.

### Changed
- **Source of Truth**: `getQuestMood` is now purely deterministic — MOOD is always calculated from the frustration/deadline engine, never inferred from AI text.
- **Parser Cleanup**: The `MOOD` field is no longer ingested from legacy text blocks. The AI may still write it for human readability, but the engine ignores it.

## [1.8.22] - 2026-05-10

**Fix: Mood Calculation — No-Deadline Quests**
Fixed the root cause of mood desync for deadline-free quests.

### Fixed
- **No-Deadline Baseline**: `computeFrustrationLocal` now returns `-1.0` ("Very Pleased") instead of `0.0` ("Neutral") when a quest has no deadline or `DEADLINE: None`. This ensures that pressure-free quests correctly show a positive NPC emotional state.

## [1.8.21] - 2026-05-10

**Enhancement: RNG Queue Guidance**
Added explicit clarification to the legacy system prompt regarding RNG queue entry consumption.

### Changed
- **Prompt Guidance**: Explicitly stated that the first number in each RNG queue entry represents the d20 result in the legacy system prompt.

## [1.8.20] - 2026-05-10

**Enhancement: Robust Difficulty Parsing**
Improved the difficulty system to allow for non-standard ratings and ensured UI stability.

### Changed
- **Flexible Difficulty**: Removed the strict enum requirement for quest difficulty, allowing the AI to use custom ratings if appropriate.
- **Rendering Fallback**: Added a robust rendering fallback in the quest log. Non-standard difficulty levels now use a neutral theme that remains legible across different visual themes.

## [1.8.19] - 2026-05-10

**Fix: Tool Registration Bug**
Fixed a `ReferenceError` that prevented the `LogQuest` tool from registering correctly when Difficulty was enabled.

### Fixed
- **Initialization Order**: Corrected the order of variable initialization in `quests.js` to ensure the `required` fields array is defined before being modified by the Difficulty logic.

## [1.8.18] - 2026-05-10

**Enhancement: UI Consistency**
Added the "Difficulty" toggle to the main extension settings panel.

### Added
- **Settings Integration**: The Quest Difficulty toggle is now available in both the startup onboarding wizard and the permanent extension settings panel.

## [1.8.17] - 2026-05-10

**Feature: Quest Difficulty Tracking**
Implemented an optional "Difficulty" system for quests, allowing the AI to assign and track challenge levels (Very Easy to Very Hard).

### Added
- **Difficulty Toggle**: New checkbox in the onboarding UI to enable/disable quest difficulty tracking.
- **Legacy Difficulty**: Support for the `DIFFICULTY:` field in legacy text-block quests.
- **Modern Difficulty**: Integrated `difficulty` parameter into the `LogQuest` tool and allowed difficulty updates in the JSON state tracker.
- **Visual Feedback**: Added color-coded difficulty badges to quest cards in the UI (e.g., Green for Easy, Red for Very Hard).

## [1.8.16] - 2026-05-10

**Fix: Hardened "Apply Sysprompt" Logic**
Fixed a bug where clicking "Apply Sysprompt Now" in the onboarding menu could occasionally result in a stale prompt if intermediate toggle events were missed.

### Fixed
- **Atomic Onboarding Apply**: The "Apply" button now performs a full scrape of all UI toggles (Deadlines, Frustration, Quest Mode, RNG Mode) immediately before generating the prompt. This guarantees the resulting sysprompt and module instructions perfectly match the visible UI state.

## [1.8.15] - 2026-05-10

**Enhancement: Legacy Quest Rewards**
Added the `REWARD:` field to the Legacy Quest Mode system instructions, bringing it to feature parity with the Standard (Modern) JSON format.

### Fixed
- **Legacy Quest Rewards**: The `quests_legacy` prompt now explicitly instructs the AI to track promised rewards using the `REWARD:` marker. While the renderer and parser already supported rewards, the instructions were missing, causing the AI to omit them in legacy mode.

## [1.8.14] - 2026-05-10

**Fix: Direct Prompt Consistency**
Fixed a bug where the "Direct Prompt" feature used its own isolated logic for building system instructions, ignoring Quest Legacy mode and other module settings.

### Fixed
- **Centralized Instruction Building**: `sendDirectPrompt` now uses the shared `buildModulesInstructionText` function, ensuring it respects the active Quest format and all other module configurations.

## [1.8.13] - 2026-05-10

**Fix: Legacy Quest Prompt Now Reliably Applied**
Resolved a critical bug where users with Legacy Quest Mode selected would still receive the Modern (JSON delta) quest prompt in the state model.

### Fixed
- **Quest Prompt Selection at Init**: Replaced the fragile runtime swap with a definitive init-time write. The correct quest prompt (Legacy or Modern) is now written directly into `stockPrompts.quests` at startup based on `questLegacyMode`, guaranteeing the state model always receives the right instructions regardless of save state.
- **Missing `stockPrompts` Guard**: Added a null-check to ensure `stockPrompts` is always initialized before the sync block runs, fixing a silent failure for users without saved prompts.

## [1.8.12] - 2026-05-10

**Prompt Routing Diagnostics**
Added internal diagnostics to track quest prompt routing.

### Changed
- **Harden Quest Prompt Routing**: Improved the logic that swaps between Legacy and Modern quest formats to be more robust.
- **Diagnostic Logging**: Added console logs to verify `questLegacyMode` status and prompt type during initialization and runtime.

## [1.8.11] - 2026-05-10

**Lorebook Synchronization & Robust Loading**
This update resolves a race condition where lorebooks would fail to populate in the extension settings.

### Fixed
- **Lorebook Initialization Race Condition**: Implemented a 3-tier fallback for loading world info names. If the in-memory list is empty, the extension now forces a backend refresh and retries, with a final direct API fetch fallback. This ensures lorebooks are always accessible regardless of SillyTavern's initialization timing.

## [1.8.10] - 2026-05-10

**Quest Framework Refinements & Progress Tracking**  
This update overhauls the quest logic to support narrative-driven failures, partial objective progress tracking, and recalibrated NPC emotional modeling.

### Added
- **Objective Progress Tracking**: Added support for quantity-based objectives (e.g., "Collect 6 Mushrooms [4/6]").
    - Visual progress pills in the quest log UI.
    - Automated state merging for partial progress updates.
    - Support for both Modern (JSON) and Legacy (Plain Text) tracking modes.
- **Dynamic Narrator Instructions**: The system prompt now automatically swaps quest instructions based on the active mode (Standard vs. Legacy) and RNG settings.
- **Automatic Prompt Synchronization**: Implemented an "auto-sync" mechanism that updates unmodified stock prompts to the latest version upon extension load.

### Changed
- **Frustration Logic Recalibration**: NPCs now stay in the "Pleased" to "Neutral" range until a deadline is actually missed. Frustration penalties now ramp up exclusively *after* the deadline has passed.
- **Narrative-Driven Failures**: Explicitly authorized the AI to trigger quest failures if an objective becomes narratively impossible (e.g., target death), independent of automated deadline logic.
- **RNG Queue Instructions**: Clarified that the first number in each `[RNG_QUEUE]` entry is the d20 result to eliminate ambiguity during combat.

### Fixed
- **Legacy Prompt Routing**: Fixed a bug where Legacy Mode was stripping instructions from the modern prompt instead of injecting the dedicated legacy prompt.
- **LogQuest Tool Descriptions**: Updated tool documentation to reflect the new post-deadline frustration behavior.

## [1.8.7] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Per-Module Pagination Thresholds**: You can now set independent pagination limits for every module (stock and custom).
    - Added "Pagination Threshold" input to the **Custom Module Editor** and **Prompt Editor**.
    - Changes update the UI in real-time as you type, allowing for instant layout fine-tuning.
- **Robust "Linear Stone" History**: 
    - **Dual-State Archiving**: Updates (both narrative and direct) now archive both the *old* and *new* states to history. This ensures that committing to a past state never permanently clobbers your most recent work.
    - **Direct Prompt Persistence**: Fixed a bug where manual tracker updates via direct instructions were lost during history traversal.
    - **Fluid Snapshot Restoration**: Clicking the nav label now restores a past state instantly without a confirmation popup, as the operation is now completely reversible.

### Changed
- **Unified History Depth**: Increased history limit for Direct Prompt updates from 5 to **1000 items** to match the narrative update cycle.
- **UI Responsiveness**: Removed the requirement to save a module configuration to see pagination changes; the tracker now re-renders immediately upon input.

### Fixed
- **Infinite Snapshot Duplicate Bug**: Resolved a logic error where jumping between historical snapshots and the "Live" state would create redundant duplicates of the same state in the history stack.
- **Clear State Pointer Bug**: Fixed a bug where clearing the tracker history didn't reset the internal state pointer, leading to incorrect history slicing on the next update.
- **Empty State Archiving**: Fixed a guard condition that prevented archiving the very first state (empty) into history.
- **Quest Settings Persistence**: Fixed a regression where "Deadlines" and "Frustration Levels" toggles failed to persist across session reloads.


## [1.8.2] - 2026-05-05

**Waterproofing RPG State Persistence**  
This update introduces a deterministic, non-regex JSON cleaner for tool-call metadata and a surgical RNG queue stripper. These optimizations eliminate token bloat caused by redundant tool signatures and metadata, saving approximately 1,500 tokens per dice roll.

### Added
- **Total Tool-Call Bloat Removal**: The State Model now completely excludes mechanics-heavy tool results (signatures, reasoning, parameters) from its context. It relies exclusively on the narrative descriptions that follow a roll, significantly reducing context usage.
- **Surgical RNG Stripping**: Implemented a "waterproof" regex mechanism for stripping `[RNG_QUEUE]` blocks from the user's last action, ensuring AI context remains clean while maintaining 100% stability.
- **Expanded RNG Queue**: Increased the pre-rolled `[RNG_QUEUE]` length from **8** to **12** to provide more headroom for complex combat encounters.

### Changed
- **Unified Versioning**: Synchronized framework version to **1.8.2** across manifest, changelog, and system prompt UI.
- **Context Filtering**: Wired the cleaner into both the automatic `StateModelPass` and the manual `Direct Prompt` pipelines to ensure consistent token savings across all interaction modes.


**Chat-Linked State Persistence**  
This major update introduces per-chat isolation for the RPG State Tracker, allowing for seamless transitions between different campaigns and characters.

### Added
- **Chat-Specific Isolation**: Memos and history are now automatically scoped to the active SillyTavern Chat ID. Switching chats will swap the tracker state instantly.
- **Smart Conflict Resolution**: When linking to a chat that has existing data, a native SillyTavern modal prompts for **RESTORE**, **OVERWRITE**, or **CANCEL**.
- **Automatic History Backup**: Discarded "Global" work is automatically pushed into the chat's history during transitions to prevent data loss.
- **Clean Slate Onboarding**: New chats automatically start with an empty tracker while preserving your custom module configurations.

### Changed
- **Unified Versioning**: Synchronized framework version to **1.8.0** across manifest, changelog, and system prompt UI.
- **Improved Modal Experience**: Replaced generic browser alerts with premium, native SillyTavern popups.

### Fixed
- **State Overwrite Bug**: Resolved an issue where toggling Chat Link could accidentally wipe existing chat data with the current live state.

## [1.7.5] - 2026-05-05

**Waterproof Markers & UI Streamlining**  
This update focuses on "waterproofing" the RPG Marker system and cleaning up the Editor UI for a more professional experience.

### Fixed
- **"Waterproof" Marker System**: Resolved a bug where visual markers like `((PILLS))`, `((BAR))`, and `((XPBAR))` were being stripped from the state data sent to the AI. The system now preserves these markers throughout the entire round-trip, ensuring 100% reliable HUD formatting.
- **ST API Compatibility**: Added support for both `max_tokens` and `max_new_tokens` in the TextCompletionService payload, ensuring stability across different SillyTavern backends.
- **UI Logic Stability**: Fixed a critical `TypeError` in `sendStateRequest` that could occur when switching between connection profiles.
- **General Linting**: Fixed multiple "silent" errors including missing header definitions, incorrect API signatures, and jQuery type-safety issues in both the main extension and the `Summaryception` connection utility.

### Changed
- **Editor UI Refinement**: Removed the "Preview" toggle button from the Custom Field Editor. On supported desktop displays, the **Testing Sandbox** is now permanently visible to provide instant feedback.
- **Version Synchronization**: Incremented framework version to **1.7.5** across the manifest and the internal system prompt footer.

## [1.7.4] - 2026-05-05

**Enhanced Connectivity and UI Refinement**  
A comprehensive upgrade to the external LLM pipeline and settings organization, enabling direct-to-backend connections with robust parameter mapping.

### Added
- **Direct Backend Connectivity**: Introduced the ability to route State Tracking requests directly to **Ollama** or **OpenAI-Compatible** endpoints (like OpenRouter, LM Studio), bypassing SillyTavern's internal profile system for ultra-low-latency background updates.
- **Universal Parameter Mapping**: Implemented a multi-tier fallback system for generation settings. The framework now correctly extracts and maps `temperature`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, and `repetition_penalty` across all SillyTavern preset formats (supporting both TextGen and OpenAI-specific key names).
- **Diagnostic Transparency**: Added high-verbosity browser console logging (Debug Mode) that explicitly outputs the `Applied Preset Data` and final `Parameters` used for each request.

### Changed
- **Settings UI Drawer System**: Refactored the settings panel into an expandable **Drawer** system. 
    - **Connection Settings** and **Advanced Options** now reside in collapsible headers to keep the main menu clean.
    - **Context & Lorebooks** has been promoted to a top-level section for better discoverability.
- **Header Aesthetics**: Updated the extension's main drawer icon and bold styling to match SillyTavern's native visual standards.
- **Layout Optimization**: Optimized button widths (Add Custom Field, Test Connection, Factory Reset) for better responsiveness in narrow sidebars.
- **Combat Tracking**: Updated the default [COMBAT] prompt to include explicit `COMBAT ROUND X` tracking per combatant.

### Fixed
- **Property Name Collision**: Resolved an issue where presets created under OpenAI profiles would fail to apply their temperature settings due to differing property names (e.g., `temp` vs `temp_openai`).
- **Button Alignment**: Fixed vertical squishing and awkward text wrapping on manual action buttons.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Silent Model/Preset Switching**: Fixed a major regression where background RPG tracker passes would ignore the selected Connection Profile and Generation Settings Preset. The system now correctly routes requests through specific models (like Gemini 3 Flash) with custom sampler overrides (like disabling reasoning) silently and reliably.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-04

**Custom Field Overhaul and Universal Markers**  
A major refactor of the Custom Field Editor and rendering engine, giving users total control over AI instructions while enabling high-fidelity markers (pills, bars) in every stock module.

### Added
- **Universal Marker Support**: `((PILLS))`, `((BAR))`, `((XPBAR))`, `((BADGE))`, and `((HIGHLIGHT))` now work in ALL built-in modules (INVENTORY, ABILITIES, SPELLS, XP, TIME).
- **Decoupled AI Instructions**: The Custom Field Editor now separates the visual template from the AI prompt, allowing for raw, unmanipulated instruction sets.
- **CFE Color Guide**: Added a one-click guide button to the Custom Field Editor to help users quickly implement colored text and rarity tags.
- **CFE Help System**: Added tooltips to the Custom Field Editor to clarify the distinction between UI previews and AI instructions.
- **Instruction Hardening**: Added a new `<custom_formatting>` block to core instructions to better guide the AI on when to use graphical markers.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-04

**Improved Customization and Advanced Options**  
Significant upgrades to editing custom fields. The formatting is now clear, and there's a live preview window, which makes design a breeze.

### Added
- **Advanced Options Update**: Deep customization for the State Model's intelligence.
- **Precision Lookback Control**: You can now specify exactly how many previous messages (User/Assistant) and how many historical tracker states the model sees when making updates.
- **Lorebook Context Support**: You can now select which specific Lorebooks the tracker is aware of during updates, ensuring it stays consistent with your world info.
- **Enhanced Custom Field Editor**:
    - **Live Preview Window**: Real-time rendering of your tracker blocks while you edit prompts.
    - **Color Support**: Full support for `<font color=#...>...</font>` tags and native WoW-style rarity tags like `[Legendary]`, `[Epic]`, etc., which are now automatically colorized.
    - **Contextual Formatting**: Module prompt examples now use stock fields (like CHARACTER and ABILITIES) to guide better formatting.

### Fixed
- **UI Headers**: Fixed a bug where the preview window would show raw tags like `__PREVIEW__` instead of proper field labels.
- **Live Preview Interactivity**: Pagination and list/page views now work correctly within the live preview window.

## [1.5.5] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Mobile Prompt Access**: Embedded system prompts directly into the code and implemented an HTTP-compatible clipboard fallback. This ensures the SYSPROMPT button works on mobile/Termux environments where local file fetching and modern clipboard APIs are often restricted.

### Added
- **Full-Screen Mobile Support**: The tracker now expands to cover the screen on mobile, optimizing space.
- **Button Alignment Fixes**: Centered all navigation and RNG buttons, ensuring they align vertically and horizontally.
- **Settings Drawer Refinement**: Polished the collapsible footer to keep settings accessible but out of the way.

### Added
- **Mobile UI Optimization**: Implemented responsive CSS for mobile devices (max-width 600px).
- **Adaptive Footer**: The bottom bar now stacks vertically on mobile, hides the character counter, and uses compact labels to prevent button overlapping and ensure reliable touch targets.

### Changed
- **Initiative System**: Shifted pre-combat initiative rolls from the RNG Queue to the Tool Call system for better narrative integration.
- **Resting Rules**: Reduced the Long Rest cooldown to 9 hours and implemented a d20-based interruption check for resting in dangerous locations.
- **RNG Queue Constraint**: Strictly isolated the RNG Queue to active combat actions only.
- **Prompt Synchronization**: Updated the legacy fallback prompt to maintain parity with the latest system rules.

### Fixed
- **Detached UI Scrolling**: Fixed an issue where undocked panels (Combat, Party, etc.) would not allow internal scrolling.
- **Resize Handle Conflict**: Resolved a bug where grabbing the resize handle on detached windows would trigger the scrollbar track.
- **Content Overflow**: Optimized card layout within detached panels to ensure proper scroll-height calculation for large entity lists.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Visual Status System**: Status effects are now color-coded. Buffs (marked with `(+)`) are Emerald Green, and Debuffs (marked with `(-)`) are Crimson Red.
- **Resource Capsule Icons**: Replaced the generic information icon with dynamic resource trackers. If an ability or spell has a usage count (e.g., `2/3`), it is displayed directly in the pill icon.
- **XML-Structured Instructions**: Completely refactored the State Model prompt using semantic XML tagging for vastly improved instruction following and clarity.
- **Enhanced Status Labeling**: Standardized status formatting to ensure both mathematical effects and durations are preserved in the HUD.
- **Dynamic Adaptive Icons**: Pill icons now expand into capsules to support multi-digit resource counts (like `10/10`) with improved typography.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Lookback Update Option**: Added a third manual update mode that allows users to specify exactly how many past assistant turns to parse. This is useful for summarizing multi-turn dialogue or complex narrative sequences without a full context audit.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Interceptor Metadata Integrity**: Refactored the RNG/State interceptor to use in-place modification. This ensures that hidden SillyTavern metadata (like Reasoning/Thinking content) is preserved exactly as the engine expects, preventing 400 errors with models like DeepSeek R1.
- **Enhanced Thinking Stripping**: Expanded the State Model pass filter to automatically strip `<thought>`, `<thinking>`, and `<reasoning>` tags to prevent API validation errors.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Multi-Part Message Tracking**: Fixed a critical bug where the State Model failed to process narrative text generated *before* a tool call within a single AI turn. The tracker now seamlessly aggregates all assistant message chunks since the last user message.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-27

### Changed
- **Settings UI Optimization**: Removed redundant "Dice & Tools" toggles from the settings panel, as they are now handled exclusively by the interactive footer buttons.
- **System Prompt Refinement**: Hardened RNG and combat rules and unified terminology around `[RNG_QUEUE v6.0_PROPER]` across all system prompt versions.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Hybrid RNG Architecture**: Introduced a dual-system approach to random number generation.
  - **RNG Queue (Combat)**: Pre-rolled dice for speed and anti-sycophancy in structured play.
  - **Tool Call RNG (Narrative)**: Reactive, AI-driven rolling for skill checks to prevent narrative "cheating."
- **"Waterproof" Narrative Logic**: Mandatory `dc` (Difficulty Class) parameter enforced in the `RollTheDice` tool. The AI must now commit to a difficulty *before* seeing the roll result.
- **Enhanced SYSPROMPT Selector**: Added a multi-version popup menu to the `SYSPROMPT` button, allowing users to choose between the **Modern (Hybrid)** and **Legacy (Queue-only)** system prompts.
- **Dynamic Footer UI**: Completely refactored the footer buttons with an "Accordion Squeeze" responsive design that hides labels/text as the UI box is resized, rather than stacking vertically.
- **Slash Commands**: Added `/roll` and `/r` commands for manual dice rolling via the command bar.

### Fixed
- **Core Stability**: Resolved a critical initialization crash in the UI core caused by a missing API provider in the slash command registration.
- **Responsive Stacking**: Fixed a bug where footer buttons would stack vertically and misalign on narrow screens.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Tool Calling Compatibility**: Resolved a critical issue where the tracker would interrupt and break SillyTavern's internal tool-calling sequences.
  - Refactored the core event listener from `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` to `GENERATION_ENDED` (and `GENERATION_STOPPED`). The State Model will now patiently wait for the entire AI tool chain to finish before triggering an update, rather than firing in the "gaps" between tool execution steps.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-04-27

### Changed
- **Buff/Debuff Logic Overhaul**: Refactored how temporary effects and stat modifications are tracked.
  - Relocated "restoration anchors" to the stat lines themselves (e.g., `AC 18 (base 13)`), allowing for cleaner status displays.
  - Standardized Status line formatting to focus on absolute mathematical effects (e.g., `Shield (+5 AC, 1 turn)`).
  - Improved Narrator and State Model synergy for automatic buff expiration and stat restoration.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Mobile Profile Management**: Resolved an issue where saving, loading, or deleting profiles would fail on mobile devices (especially iOS PWAs).
  - Replaced native `prompt()` and `confirm()` calls with SillyTavern's built-in async modal system.
  - Implemented an async event-handling pattern for the Profile UI to support non-blocking user input.
- **RNG UI Tweak**: Integrated the RNG Physics Engine toggle directly into the footer navigation bar as a professional, horizontally-centered pill button with responsive mobile scaling.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **UI Boundary Protection**: Implemented safety checks to prevent the UI from becoming inaccessible if moved or saved off-screen.
  - Added coordinate sanitization to `loadPanelGeometry` and `createDetachedPanel` to ensure the panel always spawns within the visible viewport.
  - Implemented movement constraints in the dragging logic to prevent moving the panel header beyond the browser window edges.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Custom Field Limit**: Resolved a bug that limited the number of custom fields to two. 
  - Implemented unique tag generation for new fields (e.g., `NEW_FIELD`, `NEW_FIELD_1`).
  - Added real-time tag validation to prevent duplicate or reserved tags (like `XP` or `CHARACTER`).
  - Added an auto-sanitization pass to `refreshOrderList` to automatically fix any existing duplicate tags in user settings.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Starting Level Selector**: Added a "Starting Level" dropdown (Levels 1–20) to the initial setup screen. 
- **Dynamic Archetype Generation**: The Magic, Melee, and Rogue archetype buttons now dynamically generate characters consistent with your chosen starting level (including appropriate gear and spells).
- **Advanced D&D 5e Rules**: Updated `sysprompt.txt` with specific tracking for Distance & Range, Opportunity Attacks, and disadvantage on Ranged Spells in melee combat.
- **Archetype Overhaul**: Significantly improved the character generation "wizard".
  - All archetypes (Magic, Melee, Rogue) now consistently generate **[INVENTORY]** and **[ABILITIES]** blocks.

### Fixed
- **Comma Support**: Updated the parser for HP, XP, and Hit Dice to support numbers with commas (e.g., `100,000`), preventing display failures with high-value stats.
- **UI Alignment**: Centered the level selector dropdown to sit correctly above the archetype selection buttons.

## [1.2.9] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Factory Reset**: Resolved a race condition where the page would reload before the reset request is finalized in storage. Replaced blocking alert with a non-blocking toast and delayed reload.

## [1.2.8] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Onboarding UX**: Fixed markdown bolding in the onboarding guide and scaled up all font sizes for better readability.
- **Profile Persistence**: The profile dropdown now correctly remembers the "-- No Profile --" selection across page refreshes.

### Added

## [1.2.5] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Hit Dice Tracking (HD)**: Added a new `HD` field for Characters and Party members.
  - Renders as high-fidelity gold pips (`[ dX ] 🔵🔵⚪`) to differentiate from blue spell slots.
  - Automatically included in default system prompts.
- **Last Rest Time Engine**: The `[TIME]` section now supports a `Last Rest:` field.
  - The UI dynamically calculates and displays the time elapsed (e.g., "10 hours ago") relative to the current game time.
- **Improved Prompt Clarity**: Refined prompt instructions for Time, Inventory, and HP to be more authoritative and direct.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-04-23

### Added
